# Final Project

Will Stock, wstock@ucsd.edu

## Abstract Proposal

For my final project, I continued my original proposal for my generated visual. I want to use images scraped from nike.com to generate images of Nike shoes, then create posters for a fictional Nike campaign in which new shoe designs are created by machine learning. I wanted these posters to emulate print Nike ads from the 1980s and 90s, which I find very visually appealing.
